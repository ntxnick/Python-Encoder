# Python-Encoder

This project was built to help me learn python syntax. 
This project will take input from a user, store it, then go through each character changing its value.
The output will be rendered unreadble text.
If you put this through my next project (python decoder) you will be able to decode this output back to the original text!

This python project uses: 
for loop
user input
prints to the screen
randomint
if else
